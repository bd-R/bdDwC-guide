Local file size cannot exceed 1GB [?] [ Need To Be Updated! ] Data upload from a local file 2.3.2 From an online database Also, data can be retrieved directly from various online biodiversity databases. You need only to: Select the database Specify the desired scientific name. Specify the number of records (upper limit of 50,000). Check the box if records must have coordinates. Wait for data to be downloaded. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Data upload from online biodiversity databases 2.4 Dictionary A dictionary is a key component when Darwinizing a dataset. It’s basically a lookup table that lists a possible variation of field name and it corresponding DwC names. 2.4.1 The Darwin Cloud dictionary The Darwin Cloud dictionary (Wieczorek et al. 2017), is a lookup table that accumulates different variations in DwC field names from different publishers. This valuable dictionary was created and is maintained by the Kurator project (http://kurator.acis.ufl.edu/kurator-web/), which provides workflow tools for data quality improvement of biodiversity data, via a user-friendly web interface. See The Kurator project section for more information. Updating the Darwin Cloud dictionary It’s recommended to update the Darwin Cloud file. This can be done easily by clicking the Update DC button. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Updating the Darwin Cloud 2.4.2 Your own dictionary It’s also possible to add your own dictionary by simply creating a CSV file with two columns, one for the Field Names and one for the Standard Names. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Uploading your own dictionary 2.5 Darwinizing your dataset Once a dataset is uploaded, the ‘Submit to Darwinizer’ button is activated, Clicking it will Darwinize the dataset. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Submit to Darwinizer button 2.6 Darwinizer results 2.6.1 Results page overwiew [ Need To Be Updated! ] Darwinizer results Manually renaming field names can be done very easily, just choose the two corresponding fields and click the Rename button. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Manually renaming fields Hovering over a DwC standard name will display its description. 2.7 Download your Darwinized data [ Need To Be Updated! ] 2.8 Closing the app References "],
